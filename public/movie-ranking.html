<h3>Strange Brew</h3>
<p>An old odd-ball comedy about two brothers trying to scam a brewery for free beer 
but accidentally stumble upon a plot by the head brewer to create a mind control beer.
Silly and over the top, the type of comedy to turn your brain off and grab some popcorn.</p>
<br />
<h3>The Brothers Bloom</h3>
<p>Two orphaned brothers learn to run cons at an early age and survive by conning their way through life.
The elder brother wants to write the perfect con while the younger brother wants to get out of
the con life. A few twists and turns make this an entertaining and light-hearted comedy/drama that
entertains throughout.

<br />
<h3>Bullet Train</h3>
<p>A true popcorn flick. Doesn't make you think and keeps you entertained with consistent action. Easy to follow
and looks great on screen. Good performances throughout.
